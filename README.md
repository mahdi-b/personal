##  Summary Statement of Endeavors



This document offers a brief overview of my contributions and performance since joining the University of Hawaii at Mānoa in January 2019, where I hold a dual appointment as an Assistant Professor, equally split between the Information and Computer Sciences Department and the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology. My professional activities have not only met but often surpassed the criteria outlined in my initial offer, which will be elaborated upon in the following sections.

Over the past four and a half years, my scholarly productivity has been robust, as demonstrated by numerous publications, grants, and interdisciplinary collaborations. Specifically, I have authored or co-authored '18' research papers, with one under review and one nearing submission. In terms of research funding, I have successfully secured $8.9M in grants over the past four years as PI or CO-PI. I am also a sub-project PI on two projects in a $20M NSF EPSCoR CHANGE-HI project and a Collaborator on a third one. I am also Senior Personnel on two projects (NSF INCLUDES Alliance, NSF, $10M and Project Hōkūlani Hui, DOE, $769K). The first of these aims to increase the participation of Native Hawaiian high school students in STEM fields through culturally responsive enrichment programs. The second focuses on enhancing STEM education and career opportunities for students with disabilities. These grant activities reflect my dedication to both rigorous research and promoting diversity and inclusion within STEM.

I regard the instructional aspect of my responsibilities as a critical vehicle for promoting data science and bioinformatics at UH Manoa, aligning with the University of Hawaii's strategic focus on data science and AI in a multidisciplinary setting, as well as the State of Hawaii's technological transformation goals. I have actively contributed to the creation of three distinct programs within the Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) department. Additionally, I am presently involved in crafting a Graduate Certificate in Applied Computing targeting non-computer science majors and a Professional Master's Degree in Computer Science. The Graduate Certificate is specifically designed to establish a pathway for students in marine science and other fields to gain practical expertise in data science and AI.


Since my affiliation with the University of Hawaii commenced, I have developed four novel courses and taught courses in seven diverse subjects. Additionally, I founded the Hawaii Data Science Seminar Series and initiated a Hawaii Data Science Fellowship program. I have also organized or personally taught numerous workshops. Within my educational framework, I strive to integrate culturally sensitive and relevant teaching methodologies. These methods are designed to engage students in a manner that is not only meaningful but also resonates with their individual experiences while accentuating the significance and distinctiveness of local culture. My course evaluation scores significantly exceed the average scores for UH Manoa, the College of Natural Sciences, and the Department of Information and Computer Sciences. Responses to the global appraisal question ("Overall, how would you rate this Instructor?") exceed both college and departmental averages. In addition to formal classroom instruction and research mentorship for both graduate and undergraduate students, I consider informal training sessions and public outreach to be essential dimensions of my professional role. 

As a committed academic, I have been instrumental in fostering partnerships within the University of Hawaii (UH), as well as with various business and governmental organizations. I served as the founding member and inaugural Executive Director of the Hawaii Data Science Institute, where I established training and workforce priorities in collaboration with key local business leaders. Notably, I initiated internship programs with First Hawaiian Bank and Hawaiian Airlines, providing invaluable experience and employment opportunities for UH students. My role as an external advisor to state governmental organizations has further enabled me to tailor the university's data science curriculum to local needs. Within the academic sphere, I've been deeply involved in the Information and Computer Sciences department and the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology, serving on various committees and advising student organizations. Currently, I am leading the organizational efforts for a national Data Hackathon competition, in partnership with the NSA, NASA, and a local business, aiming to offer an unparalleled learning platform on the critical issue of sea level rise.
